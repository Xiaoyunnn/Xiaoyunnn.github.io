export const aboutMeDescription = `I'm Xiao Yun, a final year student pursuing Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. As a full stack enthusiast, I have actively sought opportunities to expand my skill set in both front-end and back-end development. I have hands-on experience with front-end technologies e.g. React.js and responsive design principles. On the server side, I have worked with databases and I'm familiar with backend frameworks like Node.js. 

I am comfortable working in an agile environment, adapting to changing requirements, and meeting deadlines without compromising on quality. I thrive on challenges and continuously seek opportunities to grow in the rapidly evolving field of technology. As I embark on the journey towards my professional career, I am excited to join a dynamic team where I can leverage my skills and contribute to building innovative applications.
